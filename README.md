# Weather Generator Research (HYRAS Dataset)

July 2025 â€“ Present

 - Developing a generative model for precipitation time series that reproduces statistical properties of real-world climate data. 
 - Designed custom multiprocessing data loader that handles large number of NetCDF4 files of HYRAS (Germany precipitation) dataset. 
 - Evaluated and analyzed performance of a 3D CNN baseline model through statistical metrics and distribution fit (PDF, scatter plots). 
 - Exploring advanced architectures to improve accuracy
 - Future plans include integrating global physical constraints. 
 - Research intended to finish by end of 2025.
